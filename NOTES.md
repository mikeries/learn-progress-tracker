## Ideas for Future development
* Instructor access
* Goal setting and tracking
* Some kind of "Help Me!" button?
* Resources -> Links to helpful websites discovered while doing lessons
* Social networking -- share your data with friends? competitions? challenges?
  * Think about how fitbit/endomondo motivate people to exercise
* Capability to search read-me as well as titles/tags/notes
  * maybe utilize the google [custom search engine](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/introduction)?
